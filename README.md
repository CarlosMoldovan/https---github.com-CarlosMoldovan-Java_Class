# First Project in Java
## Overview

This Java project is designed to showcase a simple yet practical implementation of two fundamental concepts: managing a bank account and handling basic car information. It consists of four essential Java files that demonstrate various aspects of object-oriented programming and user interaction.

## Project Components
### ContBancar.java

`ContBancar.java` represents a basic bank account management system. It defines a `ContBancar` class that allows users to create an account, deposit money, withdraw funds, check the account balance, and perform random financial transactions. The class encapsulates the account's balance as a private attribute and provides methods for interacting with it.

```java
public class ContBancar {
    // Source code for the ContBancar class
    // ...
}
```
### Lab2.java

`Lab2.java` serves as the project's `main` execution file. It contains the main method, which creates instances of the `ContBancar` class and provides a menu-driven interface for users to perform banking operations. Users can deposit, withdraw, check balances, and even simulate random financial transactions. The class demonstrates the use of user input and control flow.
```java
import java.util.Scanner;
import java.util.Random;

public class Lab2 {
    // Source code for the Lab2 class
    // ...
}
```
### masinamain.java

`masinamain.java` introduces a car management system. It allows users to input car details such as name, color, and speed and displays the car's information. The class demonstrates the use of a custom `masinaclass` to encapsulate car data and provides a basic command-line interface for car management.
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class masinamain {
    // Source code for the masinamain class
    // ...
}
```
### masinaclass.java
`masinaclass.java` defines the `masinaclass`, which encapsulates car-related information such as the car's name, color, and speed. It provides methods for setting and retrieving these attributes and includes a custom `toString` method to display car information.
```java
public class masinaclass {
    // Source code for the masinaclass
    // ...
}
```

## How to Use
To run the project, compile and execute the `Lab2.java` and `masinamain.java` files, which serves as the entry point. Follow the on-screen menu to interact with the banking and car management functionalities.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to gain a deeper understanding of Java programming principles and best practices.

Enjoy working with this Java project, and happy coding!
